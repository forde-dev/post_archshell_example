## This is an extract from my [blog][forde]

Hello, this is my second blog post. In this blog i will be giving a tutorial on how to install ArchLinux.
What im going to do is create a bash shell script with all the nessasary commands needed to install
arch, then i will test and trouble shoot it using a virtual mashine until it works smoothly.
I will mostly follow the pecedure layed out by [Archlinux installation guide][guide] wehn creating this script.
I will do my best to make it as simple as possible, I also plan on making a youtube video explaining everything typed
here.

## 1. Step One.

#### Setting up,

I would recommend creating a directory(folder) or a [git repo][gitrepo] for this project.
If you are in linux and want to create a directory use the following command, just replace **"my_new_directory"** with what you want to call it.

	# example

	mkdir my_new_directory


The file layout for this project is as follows, Just create these files.

> base.sh

> post.sh

NOTE: make sure that your text editor of choice is set to LF (unix line endings) and UTF-8
this will mostly not be a problem if your writing this on linux, however if your using Windows to
write this I'd recommend using [Atom][atom] or [Notepad ++][notpad].


#### First,

Open both **base.sh** and **post.sh** to initialise the script using a **Shebang** as follows,
i will also add *set -e* this option makes the shell script error out whenever a command errors out.
It's generally a good idea to have it enabled most of the time. but this is optional.


  	#!/usr/bin/env bash

  	set -e


Just to give a bit more explaining on the **shebang** above which is the ***#!***, this tells the script where to find
the bash interpreter, typically people use ***#!/bin/bash*** but using ***#!/usr/bin/env bash*** lends you some
extra flexibility on different systems.


#### Next,
we need to guarantee that the system is in **UEFI** mode as the rest of this script depends on it.
If the archiso is ran in UEFI there will be a ***efi*** directory in the ***/sys/firmware***,
example the following path must be true for it to me **UEFI**,

> /sys/firmware/efi/

To test this in our script we can use the operator ***-d*** to test if it exists and use an **IF** statmemt to allow to program to run
or not. You can just copy the following piece of code and add it on to the **base.sh**,

	# this checks if the system is uefi
	if [ ! -d "/sys/firmware/efi/" ]; then
		echo "This script only works in UEFI"
		exit 1
	fi

## 2. Step Two.

#### Initialising variables,

Lets now continue editing the **base.sh** and create a few variables.
in case you don't know hwo to crate a variable in bash it works like the following,

	# example

	VARIABLE="items"

	# and to use the variable

	mkdir ${VARIABLE}

So the variables we will need to add to the **base.sh** are as follows,

	# set a root password
	ROOTPASSWORD="password"

	# set a username for your user
	USERNAME="user"

	# set a password for your user
	USERPASSWORD="userpassword"

	# set a hostname for the system
	HOSTNAME="computer"

	# set the drive to install on (more on that in a moment)
	DRIVE="/dev/sda"

	# set keymap for the keyboard
	KEYMAP="uk"

	# set up what packages need to be installed (also more on this below)
	PKG="base base-devel grub wireless_tools nfs-utils ntfs-3g openssh pkgfile pacman-contrib mlocate mlocate alsa-utils 		bash-completion rsync"

In the above variables you can set them all to suit your own preference.
This in **IMPORTANT**, the **DRIVE** variable has being assigned to ***"/dev/sda"*** above,
you can change this if you want, but i recommend not, although the script that we are making will wipe all the contents
on the ***"/dev/sda"*** drive, i would also recommend disconnecting any other drives in the computer when doing this install,
no need to worrie about that just yet, the following will show you how you can see what drives are which.

	# example, to check drives in your system

	lsblk

Heres an example of the output of the ***lsblk*** command.

![lsblk output][lsblk]

I will also give a closer look at the **PKG** variable, all the packages that assigned are optional, i have
picked these as they are what i wanted, you can check out your options [here][packages], if you dont understand this
dont worry too much, just use what i have provided above.

#### Finally,

We must set up a few last things before moving on to step three,
now lets sync the clocks to the systems local time using the following commands,

	# clocks
	# this enables the time controller
	echo "Setting local time"
	timedatectl set-ntp true

	# this syncs with the system clock
	hwclock --systohc --utc


Also we must set up the keyboard to match the variable up above, its done as simple as this,

	# keyboard
	# this loads the keyboard depending on your country as set in the variables
	echo "Loading Uk Keymap for the keyboard"
	loadkeys ${KEYMAP}

## 3. Step Three.

#### Partitioning,

We will create three Partitions out of the **DRIVE**,
+ efi
+ Swap
+ Root

I am going to use a tool called ***sgdisk***.
First we must wipe the drive and reformate it using the following,

	# this wipes and formates the drive
	echo "# Wriping Drive and segergating"
	sgdisk -Z ${DRIVE}


And now segergste the drive,

	# this optimumises the partition
	sgdisk -a 2048 -o ${DRIVE}

	# this makes the EFI partition
	echo "Setup UEFI Boot Partition"
	sgdisk -n 1:0:+512M -t 1:ef00 -c 1:"EFI System Partition" ${DRIVE}

	# this makes the EFI partition a vfat filesystem
	mkfs.vfat ${DRIVE}1

	# this create the swap partition
	echo "Setup Swap"
	sgdisk -n 2:0:+2G -t 2:8200 -c 2:"Swap Partition" ${DRIVE}

	# this makes the ROOT partition
	echo "Setup Root"
	sgdisk -n 3:0:0 -t 3:8300 -c 3:"Linux / Partition" ${DRIVE}

	# this sets the ROOT partitions file system to ext4
	mkfs.ext4 ${DRIVE}3

So that might be alot to take in at first so ill give little explaination on how
***sgdisk*** works,
operators im using and what they do,


**Zap all**,
this is used to destroy GPT and MBR  data stuctures
and then exit, basically wipping and formatting the disk

> -Z



**set alignment**,
aligns the start of the partitions to sectors that are multiples of this value,
this allows obtain optimum performance with SSD drives

> -a



**clear**,
Clears out all Partition data

> -o



**typecode**,
change a single partitions typecode,
uses two-byte hexadecimal number

> -t  



**new partition**,
Create a new partition,
you enter a partition number, starting sector, and an ending sector

> -n



**change name**,
changes the GPT name of a partition, this is encoded as a UTF-16,

> -c



Also after the EFI and ROOT partitions i use the command ***mkfs.fs*** which means
**make file system** and then tell it what file system you want to make e.g **ext4** for
stangered partitions like root or if you wanted to make home a seperate partition to root,
only use **vfat** for the EFI partition

#### Finally,

before we move onto the next part we must mount the partions to there relevant locations
as follows,

	# this mounts the ROOT partition
	echo "# Mounting Partitions"
	mount ${DRIVE}3 /mnt

	# this creates a /boot/efi directory
	mkdir -pv /mnt/boot/efi

	# this mounts the EFI
	mount ${DRIVE}1 /mnt/boot/efi

	# this makes the swap
	echo "Enable Swap Partition"
	mkswap ${DRIVE}2

	# this mounts the swap
	swapon ${DRIVE}2

Notice how the ROOT and EFI partitions are mounted to ***/mnt***, this is short for ***mount***,
this allows you to use the tools on the existing system to setup the file structure for the new system before using it.
Also you have to manually create the ***/mnt/boot/efi*** as seen above.

## 4. Step Four.

#### Downloading packages and installing,

First we will install [**reflector**][reflector], this will allow us to download from the most efficient mirrors for the fastest download,

	# ths installs reflector
	echo "Downloading and Install reflector installation requirements"
	pacman -Sy --noconfirm --needed reflector

	# this downloads and sort Mirrors List from Archlinux.org
	echo "Downloading and Ranking mirrors"
	reflector --verbose --protocol http --latest 200 --number 20 --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

	# this updates the database
	pacman -Syy

Also in ArchLinux the default package manager is [**Pacman**][pacman] as seen above.
Now its time to install the main system,

	# this installs all the packages that we have in our PKG variable
	echo "# Installing Main System"
	pacstrap /mnt ${PKG}
	
The most important package to install is the [***base***][base], we have that in the PKG variable up above.
Now lets create the [***Fstab***][fstab], which is what tell arch what drives to mount when it starts up,
installing ***fstab*** is done by the following,

	# this imstalls the Fstab
	echo "# Creating Fstab Entrys"
	genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

## 5. Step Five.

#### Final Configuration for **base.sh**,

To finish off the **base.sh** script we must do some configurations and then [***arch-chroot***][chroot] (this means change root) to the new root
ROOT directory we created, But now we must configure the network settings,

	# this configures the network
	echo "Configuring Network"
	rm /mnt/etc/resolv.conf
	ln -sf "/run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf" /mnt/etc/resolv.conf
	cat > /mnt/etc/systemd/network/20-wired.network <<NET_EOF
	[Match]
	Name=en*
	[Network]
	DHCP=ipv4
	NET_EOF

Now we must set a console keymap by adding youe KEYMAP settings to ***/mnt/etc/vconsole.conf***,

	# this sets the console keymap
	echo "Setting KEYMAP"
	echo "KEYMAP=$KEYMAP" >> /mnt/etc/vconsole.conf

We can set the hostname now by adding the HOSTNAME variable to the ***/mnt/etc/hostname***,

	# this sets Hostname
	echo "Setting Hostname"
	echo "${HOSTNAME}" > /mnt/etc/hostname


To set the loaction to your own country you will have to follow my example, it come defaultly set to US
but im my example i show how to change it to ireland, its the same for everyother country, im using a editor called
***sed*** in this and using the operator ***-i*** to insert text,

	# this sets the location to ireland
	echo "Setting Locale to en_IE"

	# this changes the locale to
	sed -i 's/^en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/' /etc/locale.gen
	sed -i 's/^#en_IE.UTF-8/en_IE.UTF-8/' /etc/locale.gen

	# this sets the language to english
	echo "LANG=en_IE.UTF-8" > /etc/locale.conf

	export LANG=en_IE.UTF-8
	locale-gen
	echo ""

To learn more about locale go [here][locale]
Now to set the time zone, this example used ireland again,

	# this sets Timezone
	echo "Setting Timezone"
	ln -sf "/usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Dublin" /mnt/etc/localtime

Next i will enable the network services with [***systemctl***][sysctl] to that it starts on startup,

	# this enables required services for the network
	echo "Setting up Systemd Services"
	arch-chroot /mnt systemctl enable systemd-networkd.service systemd-resolved.service

We must also install [***grub***][grub] with the following,

	# this installs grub
	arch-chroot /mnt grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=esp --bootloader-id=Archlinux
	# this configures grub
	arch-chroot /mnt grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

Lets now go a head and add in the [***arch-chroot***][chroot] and make it run **post.sh** and we must aslso copy these files over to the new
ROOT,

	# this copys the post.sh to the new ROOT and runs it
	cp post.sh /mnt/root/
	arch-chroot /mnt sh /root/post.sh ${ROOTPASSWORD} ${USERNAME} ${USERPASSWORD}
	rm /mnt/root/post.sh

In the **post.sh** we will be configuring the root password and username and password so thats why we are carrying these
variables over.
Now to finish off the **base.sh** we must unmount our drives and give a finnishing note to tell the user that they are to
restart there pc.

	# this unmounts all the mounted drives
	echo "Unmounting Drive Partitions"

	# this unmounts the Swap
	swapoff ${DRIVE}2

	# this unmounts the EFI
	umount /mnt/boot/efi

	# this unmounts the ROOT
	umount /mnt

And now for a simple finishing note,

	echo ""
	echo "Finised Core Install"
	echo
	echo
	echo
	echo "After reboot login as your user"

Finally, we have the **base.sh** script finished.

## 6. Step Six.

#### Configuration on the post.sh,

Now open your **post.sh** that you have make earlyier and aslready initialised,
first we must take in the variables we sent to it in the **base.sh**, make sure to have them at the
same order that your put them in, like this,

	# this gives the script the variables
	ROOTPASSWORD=$1
	USERNAME=$2
	USERPASSWORD=$3

Lets do some updating,

	# this basically updates all the following
	echo "updating"
	locale-gen
	hwclock --systohc
	pacman-key --populate archlinux
	pacman-key --init
	updatedb
	pkgfile --update
 
Add this to give a splash of colour,

	# this adds colour
	echo "adding colour"
	sed -i 's/#Color/Color/' /etc/pacman.conf

Now we will set up the user details and passwords for both user and root,

	# this sets up the root password
	echo "creating Root password"
	echo -e "${ROOTPASSWORD}\n${ROOTPASSWORD}" | passwd root

	# this sets up the user
	useradd -m -G wheel,users -s /bin/bash ${USERNAME}

	# this sets up the user password
	echo -e "${USERPASSWORD}\n${USERPASSWORD}" | passwd ${USERNAME}

	# this adds the the user to group for sudo
	echo '%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL' > /etc/sudoers.d/10_wheel
	chmod 640 /etc/sudoers.d/10_wheel

Add this for creating missing directorys,

	# this creates any missing directories
	mkdir -p /etc/pacman.d/hooks

Now lets give user sudo access,

	# Change sudoers to allow nobody user access to sudo without password
	echo 'nobody ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL' > /etc/sudoers.d/99_nobody

Next build directorys and set there permissions, the [***chmod***][chmod] is used to set permissions,
the [***chgrp***][chgrp] is used to change the group and ***setfacl*** modifies the access control list (**ACL**),the
operator ***-m*** modifies the ACL specified by the **EntryOrFile**,

	# this creates directorys and set permissions
	mkdir /tmp/build
	chgrp nobody /tmp/build
	chmod g+ws /tmp/build
	setfacl -m u::rwx,g::rwx /tmp/build
	setfacl -d --set u::rwx,g::rwx,o::- /tmp/build
	cd /tmp/build/

Now lets create the [**AUR**][aur] helper, I will be using [***yay***][yay], this is written in [***GO***][go],
if you install this it can be your one and only packet manager.

	# Install Yay AUR Helper
	sudo -u nobody curl -SLO https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/snapshot/yay.tar.gz
	sudo -u nobody tar -zxvf yay.tar.gz
	cd yay
	sudo -u nobody makepkg -s -i --noconfirm
	cd ../..
	rm -r build

Finally we will edit the ***sudoers.d*** again and allow wheel group access to sudo with password,

	# Change sudoers to allow wheel group access to sudo with password
	rm /etc/sudoers.d/99_nobody

Yay!! we have just finished creating the scripts needed to install ArchLinux,
now just upload it to github
